## Introduction

### Assignement requirements :memo:
This project is part of an applied portion of the a course on theoritical 
concepts of computer science. The project is based on the following requirements:
- [x] Choose a reference manual for a subject of interest in computer science (_The Rust Programming Language_ by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols) [[1]](#1)
- [x] Follow the book to learn the concepts and apply to the proposed projects from the book.
- [x] Make a presentation of the theoritical concepts of <span style="color:orange">Rust</span>.
- [x] Demonstrate with practical projects examples from the book

### Personal objectives :dart:

Learn the basic and specific features of <span style="color:orange">Rust</span> and present them in a clear and concise manner to the which have no prior knowledge of the language.

Gain practical experience by implementing the projects from the book and demonstrate the capabilities of the language in real-world apps.

**Practical projects**:
- [x] **Project #0**: Guessing game CLI app
- [x] **Project #1**: Write an I/O CLI program (`grep` clone)
- [ ] Optional Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server


## Development environment setup :hammer_and_wrench:

Easy to install and use, Rust comes with a package manager called Cargo that helps with building, testing and managing Rust projects. The Rust compiler is called `rustc` and is used to compile Rust code.

The Rust toolchain includes the following tools:
- `rustc`: Rust compiler
- `cargo`: Package manager and build tool
- `rustup`: Rust toolchain manager

Going through the basics of setting up the development environment and creating a new project with Cargo...

## Applied projects :mag:

Along with the theoritical concepts, the book provides practical projects to apply the concepts learned. The projects are designed to be simple and build upon each other to demonstrate the capabilities of the language.
